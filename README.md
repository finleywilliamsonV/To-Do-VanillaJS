# To-Do-VanillaJS

A simple to-do list implementing a variety of features.

## Objective
I created this app to test & refine the following skills:
  - use vanilla JS to create a server, and serve a basic website
  - serve static files like css and js
  - use views to dynamically create the page
  - implement Bootstrap and use to style the page
  - implement and use an external library (Draggable.js)
  - use GitHub as a version control system
  
 ## Getting Started
 This app uses yarn, run the following to set it up.
 ```
 yarn install
 ```
 The app can be served by running:
 ```
 node app.js
 ```
 At which point the site will be served on port 3000, which can be visited at:
 ```
 localhost:3000
 ```
