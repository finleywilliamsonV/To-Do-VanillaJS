# To-Do-VanillaJS

A simple to-do list implementing a variety of features.

## Objective

I created this app to test & refine the following skills:

-   use vanilla JS to create a server, and serve a basic website
-   serve static files like css and js
-   use views to dynamically create the page
-   store and retrieve user data in localstorage
-   implement Bootstrap and use to style the page
-   use GitHub as a version control system

## Getting Started

This app uses yarn, run the following to set it up.

```
yarn install
```

The app can be served by running:

```
node app.js
```

At which point the site will be served on port 3000, which can be visited at:

```
localhost:3000
```
